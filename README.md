# RicohMasterDateFinder

Tool that extracts mastering dates from AVI and WAV files created by the RICOH Caplio G3 and similar cameras and sets it as file creation date. Useful if you try to sort those files by date within your collection.

This tool does not support JPG photos since their date is saved in a separate field that can be read by Explorer.

While AVI files do contain date and time, WAV files only contain the date. The time for those will be set to 00:00.

## How to use
Simply drag and drop the AVI or WAV files onto the executable. Multiple files are supported. Afterwards you may need to refresh the explorer window or reopen the folder to see the updated dates.
